# Spartanpods Logo PCB Variations
Use Version 2 as the production model

# Version Description:
Version 1 is the original wave text version
Version 2 is the SQUARE PCB version (USE THIS ONE)
Version 3 is an incomplete start for a Helmet ONLY version. I have not completed it (no circuit) but the PCB is there for you to use

# To Do For You (Max):
Confirm SWITCH positioning
  - If alternate switch used, be aware of "Through-Hole nubs" on most other SMD switches (holes will be visible from the other side)
    
Phototransistor position
  - I did not leave the phototransistor overhanging over the edge, so be aware plaving it down will ~always appear as night-light active mode (I did this to leave a clean edge)
      + Adjust position to overhang if not desired
   
Battery:
  - Currently using a CR2032 coin cell because I already had the circuit done
  - Could probably fit AA or AAAs on here instead (or even a 9v adapter and use that as built-in stand)
